# SwipeChef Android App

A powerful Android application that lets users capture recipes from screenshots, organize them into swipeable cards, and generate grocery lists using AI-powered recipe extraction.

## Features

- 📸 **Recipe Capture**: Share images with SwipeChef to extract recipes using OpenAI Vision API
- 📱 **Swipe Planning**: Browse recipes with swipe gestures to plan meals
- 🛒 **Smart Grocery Lists**: Automatically generate categorized shopping lists
- ☁️ **Cloud Sync**: Supabase backend for data storage and synchronization
- 🔄 **Android Share Integration**: Capture recipes directly from other apps

## Architecture

The app is built using modern Android development practices:

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: View Binding with Material Design 3
- **Navigation**: Navigation Component with Bottom Navigation
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage + Auth)
- **AI**: OpenAI Vision API for recipe extraction
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Repository pattern

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- Java 17+ (for Android Gradle Plugin 8.x)
- Android SDK with API 24+

### 2. Clone and Open Project
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open the `SwipeChef` folder as an existing Android Studio project
3. Let Gradle sync the project

### 3. Configure Backend Services

#### Supabase Setup:
1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Import the provided `supabase_schema.sql` into your project
3. Get your project URL and anon key
4. Update `SupabaseClient.kt` with your credentials:
   ```kotlin
   private const val SUPABASE_URL = "your_project_url"
   private const val SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "your_anon_key"
   ```

#### OpenAI API Setup:
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Update `OpenAIService.kt`:
   ```kotlin
   private val apiKey = "your_openai_api_key"
   ```

### 4. Build and Run
1. Build the project: `Build > Make Project`
2. Run on device/emulator: `Run > Run 'app'`

### 5. Create APK
To build a distributable APK:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug    # Debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease  # Release APK (requires signing)
```

APK will be created in: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/` or `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`

## Usage

### Capturing Recipes
1. Share an image with SwipeChef from any app
2. The app will process the image and extract recipe information
3. Edit and save the recipe

### Meal Planning
1. Navigate to the "Plan" tab
2. Swipe through recipe cards
3. Swipe right to select recipes for your meal plan
4. Generate a grocery list when you have enough recipes

### Grocery Shopping
1. View categorized ingredients in the "Grocery" tab
2. Check off items as you shop
3. Share your list with others

## Development Status

This is a functional framework with all core components implemented:

### ✅ Completed
- Complete project structure and build configuration
- Data models and database schema
- Supabase client configuration
- OpenAI Vision API integration
- Repository layer for data operations
- Main activity with navigation
- Basic UI fragments and layouts
- Image processing utilities
- Grocery list generation logic
- Android share intent handling

### 🚧 To Be Implemented
- Full UI implementations for each fragment
- Recipe card designs and animations
- ViewPager2 swipe functionality
- User authentication flow
- Image upload and management
- Advanced recipe editing features
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit and integration tests

## Key Technical Features

### AI Recipe Extraction
The app uses OpenAI's Vision API to extract structured recipe data from images:
- Parses ingredients with quantities and categories
- Extracts cooking steps and timing information
- Validates completeness and suggests missing information

### Smart Grocery List Generation
Advanced algorithm that:
- Combines ingredients from multiple recipes
- Merges duplicate items intelligently
- Categorizes items by grocery store sections
- Handles quantity conversions and measurements

### Android Integration
- Deep share intent integration for seamless recipe capture
- Material Design 3 with proper theming
- Navigation component for smooth transitions
- Storage permissions handling

## Configuration Files

### Important Files to Configure:
1. `app/src/main/java/com/swipechef/app/data/remote/SupabaseClient.kt` - Add your Supabase credentials
2. `app/src/main/java/com/swipechef/app/data/remote/OpenAIService.kt` - Add your OpenAI API key
3. `supabase_schema.sql` - Import into your Supabase project

### Android Manifest Features:
- Internet permissions for API calls
- External storage access for image processing
- Share intent filters for recipe capture
- Network security config for API endpoints

## Security Considerations

- API keys should be moved to BuildConfig or secure storage in production
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented in Supabase
- Network security configuration for HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation for all user data

## Performance Optimizations

- Image compression before upload and API calls
- Lazy loading for large recipe collections
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Background processing for AI extraction

## License

This project is for demonstration purposes. Please ensure you comply with:
- OpenAI API usage terms and rate limits
- Supabase service terms
- Android development and distribution guidelines

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the Android Studio build logs for specific errors
2. Verify API credentials are correctly configured
3. Ensure all required permissions are granted
4. Test on physical device for best performance
